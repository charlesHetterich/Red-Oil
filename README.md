#Red Oil
######June 2014 - August 2014

Red Oil was the first and only game I worked on with somebody else. I spent a long time looking for a team of people to work with, and eventually I met somebody on newgrounds.com who was willing to work with me as an artist. We never really had an end goal for the game, I just added ideas as I came up with them or as he suggested them. I spent an incredibly long time working on this game and for me it was very helpful and exciting because it was my first experience that I had to spend a lot of time on optimizations. The lighting was also an incredibly difficult puzzle for me which I spent a lot of time on.

From the beginning, the artist I was working with wasn't putting in very much effort and over time he became less committed. And he was trying to take credit for the entire project, so I decided I didn't want to work with him anymore and I didn't want to take the ideas and art that he did put in, so I moved on to something new. When we stopped working we were right in the middle of adding enemies to the game.
